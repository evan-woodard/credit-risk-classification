# credit-risk-classification
A project exploring credit risk to lenders using supervised learning

## Overview of the Analysis

In this section, describe the analysis you completed for the machine learning models used in this Challenge. This might include:

* The purpose of this analysis was to used existing knowns of current and past recipients of loans to predict their likelihood of paying off their loans with known givens in the future.
* We considered the following information: size of the loan, income of borrower, interest rate, debt to income ratio, number of accounts, derogatory marks, and total debt.
* We used logistic regression and random oversampler.

## Results

* Machine Learning Model 1:
  * Very accurately labeled loan status 0, decent-but-not-great labeling of status 1.

* Machine Learning Model 2:
  * Description of Model 2 Accuracy, Precision, and Recall scores.

## Summary

Summarize the results of the machine learning models, and include a recommendation on the model to use, if any. For example:
* Which one seems to perform best? How do you know it performs best?
* It seems more important to accurately predict who will not pay back their loans than those who will.

If you do not recommend any of the models, please justify your reasoning.
